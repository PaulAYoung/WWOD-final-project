Setup
==================
Requirements can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Data can be downloaded from the California Department of Education by running
`python get-cal-ed-data.py`. Some of these data files (the .exe files) need to be extracted on *nix machines you can just run `unzip data/*.exe`on *nix machines you can just run `unzip data/*.exe` You can combine data from different years by running `python ed-data-compile.py`.
