WWOD-final-project
===================

This is my final project for working with open data spring 2014. 

Setup
==================
Requirements can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Data can be downloaded from the California Department of Education by running
`python get-cal-ed-data.py` and combine data from different years by running
`python ed-data-compile.py`.
